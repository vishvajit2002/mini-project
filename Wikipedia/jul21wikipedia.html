            <hr>
            <img src="./img/bp1 (1).jpg" alt="Blackpink at Coachella" class="main-image">
            <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Blackpink (Korean: Î∏îÎûôÌïëÌÅ¨; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, stylized in all caps or as BL…ÖœΩKPI–òK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment. The group is composed of four members: Jisoo, Jennie, Ros√©, and Lisa. They are stylistically associated with the "girl crush" concept in K-pop, which explores themes of self-confidence and female empowerment. They are a leading force in the Korean Wave and have attracted a large global fanbase, resulting in various publications citing them as the "biggest girl group in the world".Blackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number one with Born Pink (2022). Blackpink's studio albums The Album (2020) and Born Pink each broke the record for the best-selling album by a female act in South Korea, becoming the first to surpass one million and two million copies sold, respectively. Born Pink was the first album by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard 200 since Danity Kane in 2008, and it set two Guinness World Records as the first album by a Korean girl group to top the Billboard 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single, "Pink Venom" (2022), was the first song by a Korean group to reach number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first by a girl group to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200.
Blackpink has broken numerous records throughout their career; their Born Pink World Tour (2022‚Äì23) became the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group and Asian act, and they were the first Asian act to headline Coachella. They have the most-subscribed and most-viewed music artist channel on YouTube, and are the most-followed and most-streamed girl group on Spotify. Blackpink's accolades include several Golden Disc Awards, MAMA Awards, People's Choice Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards; they became the first girl group to win Group of the Year at the latter awards in the 21st century. Outside of music, they have acquired endorsement deals in various industries and heavily incorporate fashion into their public image. For their work as advocates for climate change awareness, the group was invested as honorary Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2023. Blackpink was the first girl group to enter Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia and was named Time's 2022 Entertainer of the Year. The group has been ranked among the top of the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40 list and recognized by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in for spreading K-pop and Korean culture worldwide.</p>

            </h2>
            <img src="./img/bp2.jpg" alt="Blackpink Performance" class="main-image">
            <p>Blackpink began forming in 2010 when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, the previous year. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as "more strict than school" and Ros√© comparing it to The X Factor with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.[2] Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.[3] Consequently, numerous news stories and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.[4] It was until May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.[5] The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who was introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.[6][7]</p>
